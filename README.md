## Description

A javascript version of the coilCAM system for clay 3D printing, enabling the use of mathematically-defined toolpaths in the generation of parametric forms and surface textures for 3D-printing ceramics. This web tool, originally developed as a visual scripting plug-in for Grasshopper, is developed by the Expressive Computation Lab at the University of California, Santa Barbara.
